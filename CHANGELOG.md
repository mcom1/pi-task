# Changelog

All notable changes to `@heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-task` are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- HerdR subagents are pinned to the parent Pi tab instead of splitting whichever tab is globally focused.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Optional HerdR execution backend with geometry-aware, serialized pane spawning, socket/terminal ownership checks, durable resume steering, and parent-owned cleanup.
- `PI_TASK_BACKEND=auto|herdr|tmux|sdk`; `auto` uses HerdR only when Pi already runs in a HerdR-managed pane.

### Changed

- Task titles now prefix the agent name with `⚙` (for example, `⚙ reviewer`) in initial, live-progress, and completion output.
- Task lifecycle persistence records completion before terminal cleanup, preventing orphaned widget entries.

### Fixed

- HerdR steering sends text followed by exactly one Enter.
- HerdR child exit sentinels no longer race the parent completion poller.
- Removed dead internal declarations and registered all behavioral tests in the package test command.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- SDK widget regression coverage for tool events, polling isolation, lifecycle invalidation, and background settlement.

### Changed

- Non-tmux SDK task widgets now update only on task state changes instead of repainting continuously.
- Foreground SDK task results now use the same structured expand/collapse result contract as tmux and background tasks.

### Fixed

- SDK task widgets retain bash invocation details, render the newest tool call, and keep background rows until SDK settlement.
- Tmux foreground tasks continue using JSONL tool-stat polling after backend discrimination was introduced.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- `test/taskWidget.test.ts` coverage for foreground/background widget spacing, connector layout, collapse behavior, and waiting/done/error states.

### Changed

- Task launch receipts now show the exact subagent JSONL path instead of tmux session/artifact directory lines.
- Foreground textual progress now mirrors the background receipt shape to avoid duplicating the widget's latest tool-call line.
- Background widget now uses the same two-line header/detail tree layout as foreground.
- `task` docs and schema now require a stronger prompt contract: goal, non-goals, write/read policy, stop condition, and verification recipe.
- `npm test` now includes `test/taskWidget.test.ts`.

### Fixed

- Foreground widget now collapses in-flight tool-call output instead of repeating many lines.
- Background widget spacing/indent is visually aligned across waiting, running, done, and error states.
- Removed stale harness references and dead foreground-progress `outputLines` plumbing.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- Rich tmux subagent failure diagnostics: reports expected session dir, JSONL presence, startup hints, and pane tail when available.
- `PI_TASK_CHILD_NO_EXTENSIONS=1` to run child Pi sessions with `--no-extensions` while debugging extension-load crashes.
- Shared task title renderer for consistent foreground/background task title formatting.
- Polling regression coverage for overlapping background poll ticks.

### Changed

- Background task receipt text is shorter: removes extra tmux/session parentheticals.
- Background task completion uses theme `toolSuccessBg` instead of hardcoded ANSI RGB.
- Running and completed task UI spacing is aligned for task titles, stats, and expand/collapse hints.
- `npm test` now includes `test/polling.test.ts`.

### Fixed

- Background polling now reads subagent sessions from `artifacts/tasks/sessions/<taskId>` instead of the artifacts root.
- Background polling now uses an in-flight guard so slow poll ticks cannot duplicate completion notifications.
- Timeout/pane-exit diagnostics no longer collapse into an opaque “Subagent pane exited” message when session artifacts exist.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Bundled **general** agent; roster **explore**, **scout**, **general**, **reviewer** (removed bundled worker / planner / vision).
- Agent YAML: **`hidden`** (exclude from catalog + block `task` invoke), **`proactive`** (PROACTIVE block in tool description), **`readonly`** (deny write/edit/apply_patch/harness; bash allowed).
- `resolveTaskAgentPreflight`, dynamic `buildTaskToolDescription(agents)` catalog from discovered agents.
- Task prompt **Workspace scope** section (`buildTaskPrompt`); parent guideline for absolute repo paths when cwd ≠ target.
- `test/prompt.test.ts`; smoke check that `pi --version` meets peer `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` (skip if `pi` not on PATH).
- Frontmatter parsing tests (`hidden` / `proactive` / `readonly`).

### Changed

- `TASK_PROMPT_INSTRUCTIONS` aligned with XML result envelope; `TASK_RESULT_XML_INSTRUCTIONS` use `<summary>` (not stale `<episode>`).
- Bundled `explore` / `scout` agent docs: workspace rules; deduplicated bullets.
- Background task expand hint: closing `)` uses dim theme (was default white after inner ANSI reset).
- Foreground task widget: status line stays one row; tool lines capped (5) in onUpdate + bottom widget (8) to avoid overlapping agent • tools • duration when >10 toolcalls.
- Foreground sticky `renderCall`: show `agent • description` until elapsed ≥1s or tool count &gt;0 (no static `0 toolcalls • 0s`).
- `readProgress(sessionDir)`: same path as `countToolUses` for foreground polling (fixes reviewer path mismatch).
- Foreground sticky `renderCall`: agent `toolTitle`; tool count `text`; duration `success`.
- Task result body (foreground + background): stats use **`muted`** toolcalls + **`success`** duration (`formatElapsed`); sticky `renderCall` while running keeps **`text`** tool count (widget-style).
- Task-complete notification title: agent `toolTitle`, description `muted` (aligned with foreground sticky).
- Background: collapsed result shows **one** latest `⎿` tool line (not full multiline stream); bottom widget **1** tool line per background task (foreground widget still 8).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Structured task results.** `parseResultXml` accepts canonical `<result>` tags
  and agent `<episode>` aliases (`sources` → evidence, `blockers` → caveats,
  `checks` → next_steps, `decisions` → findings). `buildTaskEnvelope` maps
  parsed XML into tool `details` for the TUI.
- **Shared result rendering.** `renderTaskResultBody` powers foreground
  `renderResult` and background `task-complete` notifications (Summary /
  Findings / Evidence / Files / Caveats / Next steps, Ctrl+O expand).
- **Foreground progress Ctrl+O.** `renderCall` respects `context.expanded`;
  sticky header shows recent tool lines when expanded (no duplicate `⎿` glyphs
  in the result body).
- **`lifecycle/completion.ts`.** Background completion sends parsed `details`
  (`structured_result`, `full_output`, section fields) instead of dumping raw XML.
- **Tests** for episode alias parsing, background receipt, and `formatTaskEnvelope`.

### Changed

- **Background start receipt.** Plain three-line receipt with `⎿ Started task…`
  (no `<task>` XML wrapper); Tmux and sessions lines align under **Started**.
- **Background TUI spacing.** `details.background` uses tight layout: one leading
  space on stats, preview, section labels/lines, and ` (ctrl+o …)` hints;
  branch lines starting with `⎿` are not double-indented.
- **Plain-text result fallback** uses `PLAIN_SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS` (500) for
  non-XML subagent replies.

### Fixed

- **task-complete TUI crash.** Renderer returns a `Box` with composed children
  instead of passing `root.render(0)` into `Text` (`trim is not a function`).
- **Background expand showed one-line summary only** — completion `details` now
  include full parsed sections for Ctrl+O.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- **`background: true` support for SDK backend.** The Pi task tool now
  accepts `background: true` when running inside the SDK (non-tmux
  backend). The subagent's `AgentSession` lives in the host's process;
  its subscriptions and extension context stay valid as long as the
  parent session is alive, which is what OpenPi's sidecar guarantees.
- **`stale-ctx` filtering.** `extension_error` events that come from
  a Promise rejection whose message mentions "this extension ctx is
  stale" are now swallowed before the UI sees them. The host's
  session-replacement path was triggering a benign race during reload.
- **Task-session-history helpers.** New `task-session-history.json`
  is the source of truth for runtime task status. The renderer no
  longer reads `TASKS.md` for status or navigation.
- **Cancelled foreground navigation is normalized.** A click on a
  pending task row no longer aborts the running child; the row stays
  unclickable until the task settles.

### Fixed

- **`reload_session` no longer leaks extension timers.** The sidecar
  now does a full session replacement (dispose + startSession) on
  reload, which atomically destroys the old runner and its timers.
- **Background tmux panes self-destruct on exit.** Pane
  `remain-on-exit` and `setPaneSelfDestruct` are set so dead tasks
  don't accumulate.
- **Restore reconciles registry with JSONL.** On startup,
  `restoreActiveBackgroundTasks` walks the registry and the
  per-task JSONL, marking tasks done/failed and killing stale panes.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-25

### Changed

- **Modular refactor of `src/`.** The single-file `index.ts` is now a thin
  wiring layer; the implementation is split across focused modules:
  - `src/tool/` — `renderCall`, `renderResult`, `taskComplete`, `prompt`,
    `schema`.
  - `src/lifecycle/` — `polling`, `completion`, `toolStats`, `widget`,
    `restore`.
  - `src/subagent/` — `buildArgv`, `runSdk`, `tmux`, `waitCompletion`.
  - `src/conversation.ts` — `findJsonlSessionByName`, registry and
    `task-session-history` helpers.
  - `src/constants.ts` — `BACKGROUND_CHECK_MS`, `COUNT_POLL_MS`,
    `TASK_TIMEOUT_MS`, `MAX_POLL_ERRORS`.
  - `src/types.ts` — `BackgroundTask`, `RegistryEntry`,
    `TaskSessionHistoryEntry`, `TaskDetails`.
- **Session JSONL is now the single source of truth for task results.**
  `RESULT.md` is no longer read for completion detection or result text —
  the final assistant message in `~/.pi/agent/sessions/.../<id>.jsonl`
  is the authoritative result. This removes mid-write `EACCES` and
  "stale truncated `RESULT.md`" failure modes entirely.
- **Completion detection is gated on `stopReason`.** `hasAgentFinished()`
  in `src/session-text.ts` only treats an assistant message as final when
  its `stopReason` is `stop`, `endTurn`, `length`, `error`, or `aborted`.
  `toolUse` mid-turn streaming text is correctly ignored.
- **Background polling is hardened.**
  - `checkInFlight` guard prevents overlapping poll ticks (no more
    double-completion races on the `backgroundTasks` map).
  - `MAX_POLL_ERRORS = 3` per-task counter absorbs transient filesystem
    errors; a single rejected `readFile` no longer orphans a task.
  - Try/catch around `checkTaskCompletion()` keeps the interval alive on
    one-off failures.
- **Reordered completion check flow.** Session JSONL is consulted before
  pane liveness, so `remain-on-exit` panes no longer block detection.

### Added

- `renderCall` / `renderResult` / task-complete renderers with **Ctrl+O
  expand/collapse** (via `keyHint("app.tools.expand")`) on the `task`
  tool. Foreground results show stats + preview; expanded shows the full
  result text. The keybinding hint falls back to `Ctrl+O` if the
  `app.tools.expand` keybinding is not registered.
- **Foreground real-time tool-call progress.** The foreground `execute`
  path now polls the session file and emits `_onUpdate` callbacks while
  waiting, so the parent pane shows a live `${n} tool calls` count
  alongside the spawned subagent pane.

### Fixed

- The "scout - Description" / "scout — Description" duplicate header in
  foreground results: `renderResult` no longer re-renders the header
  that `renderCall` already rendered.
- The `( to expand)` empty-keybinding hint: now falls back to a plain
  `Ctrl+O to expand` label when `keyText("app.tools.expand")` is empty.

### Verified

- `npm run typecheck` passes
- `npm run build` passes
- `npm run smoke` passes
- `npm pack --dry-run` succeeds

## [0.1.6] — 2026-06-25

### Changed

- Per-task data is now in flat files at the top of `.pi/artifacts/`.
  No per-task subdirs, no `<task-id>` paths. The pikit canonical
  files (TODO.md, PLAN.md, PROGRESS.md, DECISIONS.md) are flat at the
  same level; pi-task files now sit alongside them.
- Refined the task TUI widget and background completion rendering:
  foreground/background task stats now use consistent colors, background
  completion summaries use a padded themed result block, completed
  background widgets no longer duplicate the main-pane completion, and
  final tool-call counts now match the live widget count.

### Layout

- `.pi/artifacts/TASKS.md` — one `### <task-id>` block per task, with
  H4 subsections for `#### Metadata` (JSON) and `#### Result`.
- `.pi/artifacts/task-sessions.json` — registry mapping
  `conversation_id` to `{ task_id, session_file }`. Renamed from
  the v0.1.5 `task-conversations.json`.
- The subagent's session is auto-saved by pi at
  `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`. pi-task reads
  the last assistant message from there to populate `#### Result`
  in `TASKS.md`. The subagent's final assistant message IS the
  result; no separate result file is required.

### Removed

- `.pi/artifacts/task-<id>/` per-task subdirs (and the
  `metadata.json` + `SESSION.md` + `sessions/` files inside them).
  All per-task data lives in `TASKS.md` blocks now.
- `.pi/artifacts/task-conversations.json` — replaced by
  `task-sessions.json`.
- The `taskArtifactName(taskId)` / `taskIdFromArtifactName(name)`
  helpers and the `getArtifactsDir(piDir)` / `getTaskDir(piDir)` /
  `getTaskRunsDir(piDir)` helpers.

### Verified

- `npm test` passes
- `npm run typecheck` passes
- `npm run build` passes
- `npm run smoke` passes

## [0.1.4] — 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- Detect the current tmux pane size before launching a task pane and choose
  the split direction based on available space: side-by-side for wide panes,
  stacked for narrow panes.
- Target the exact pane that was measured when running `tmux split-window`,
  avoiding focus races where a different pane could be split.
- Apply the same pane-size-aware split logic to the subagent tmux helper.

### Verified

- `npm test` passes
- `npm run typecheck` passes
- `npm run build` passes
- `npm run smoke` passes
- `npm pack --dry-run` succeeds
- Real tmux integration check passed for narrow `120x40` and wide `200x40`
  sessions.

[0.1.4]: https://github.com/heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-task/releases/tag/v0.1.4

## [0.1.3] — 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- Replaced tmux task startup via `send-keys` with direct
  `split-window <command>` execution so long, quoted `pi ...` launch
  commands are not truncated or interrupted by terminal input buffering.
- Hardened tmux steering/follow-up text injection by using tmux buffers
  (`load-buffer` + `paste-buffer`) instead of typing long text via
  `send-keys`.

### Verified

- `npm test` passes
- `npm run typecheck` passes
- `npm run build` passes
- `npm run smoke` passes
- Long task-tool tmux launch stress test passed with quotes, backticks,
  shell expansions, redirects, newlines, unicode, and long prompt text.

[0.1.3]: https://github.com/heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-task/releases/tag/v0.1.3

## [0.1.2] — 2025

### Fixed

- **Missing `pi.extensions` field in `package.json`.** Without it,
  the package was installed by `pi install` but pi's package loader
  didn't recognize it as an extension, so the `task` tool was never
  registered.

  Added:

  ```json
  "pi": {
    "extensions": [
      "./dist/index.js"
    ]
  }
  ```

### Verified

- `npm run build` succeeds
- `npm test` 1/1 pass
- `tsc --noEmit` clean
- `npm view @heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-task@0.1.2 pi` returns
  `{ extensions: [ './dist/index.js' ] }`

  [0.1.2]: https://github.com/heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-task/releases/tag/v0.1.2

## [0.1.1] — 2025

### Fixed

- `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` and `@earendil-works/pi-tui` moved
  from `peerDependencies` and `devDependencies` to `dependencies`. They
  are runtime imports (the dist imports `@earendil-works/pi-tui` for
  `Text` and `truncateToWidth`), so they need to ship in the npm
  tarball.

  Under `npm install --omit=dev` (the default used by `pi install`),
  peer dependencies are not auto-installed into the package's own
  `node_modules`, which caused the load error:

  ```
  pi loading extension "@heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-task"
    Cannot find package '@earendil-works/pi-tui'
  ```

### Changed

- Pinned `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` and `@earendil-works/pi-tui`
  to `^0.79.0` (was `*`).
- Removed redundant `devDependencies` entries that overlapped with the
  new `dependencies`.

### Verified

- `npm run build` succeeds
- `npm test` 1/1 pass (the helper test)
- `tsc --noEmit` clean
- The dist `dist/index.js` references `@earendil-works/pi-tui`
  (the correct, current package name)
